    "## Learning Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The are two challenges:\n",
    "* Having a good enough resume to get interviews (Focus on this)\n",
    "* Passing the interview and getting an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's unreasonable to both have a strong no-degree resume and also be competitive in theory-heavy interviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are enough ML opportunities that have practical interviews and light theroy requirements. It's best to focus on those gigs and maintain momentum. Work experience will give you a significant boost in later job hunts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the goal for those three months are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn data-centric problem-solving tools.\n",
    "* Identify, scope, communicate and solve problems.\n",
    "* Build a portfolio with externally validated results.\n",
    "* Gain a light overview of ML and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong portolio weighs heavier than a boot camp graduation. Boot camps can be inconvenient and expensive also.\n",
    "* Nano Degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Specific ML Certificates(Customer-centric roles for specific cloud providers find this useful)\n",
    "* GCP\n",
    "* Azure\n",
    "* AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical ML Courses\n",
    "Pick a practical ML course and study it for one month. You might think that one month of ML is not enough to build your projects. But it is. You'll be rusty and need to check things frequently, but you have enough to start soving data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid practical ML courses for coders include \n",
    "* FastAI\n",
    "* Kaggle's 30 days of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's less important if you use a paid solution, an open-source library, write models from scratch or know all the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "What matters is spotting potential risks and weaknesses with your solutions and lerning how to mitigate them. That's what modern learning is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The things you want to learn include: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Solving \n",
    "* Know the domain of problems ML can and can't solve.\n",
    "* Know when you should use paid APIs, open-source or custom solutions.\n",
    "* Basic Awareness of how your model impacts a business including privacy, UI/UX, legal, ethics and their business model.\n",
    "* Communicating expectations and timelines to technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "* How and when to mitigate risk from your inexperience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "* Understanding what data is available to you and how to get more.\n",
    "* Extracting, visualizing, cleaning and loading data.\n",
    "* Understand the data and make informed decisions based on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models\n",
    "* Understanding the type of problem and how to find a solution.\n",
    "* Setting and measuring appropriate objectives and success criteria.\n",
    "* Quickly reaching a baseline.\n",
    "* Training models with state-of-the-art results.\n",
    "* Fast and efficient debugging.\n",
    "* Visualizing model performance.\n",
    "* Deploying models and understanding memory, cost, queries-per-second, and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like a lot, but they are often a byproduct of building an industry-standard portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "After your month-long practical course including looking things up on various sources, your focus should be 90% on your portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a resume as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breadth, Credibility, and Edge\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is the most exciting area and as the most future potential. Classic machine learning approaches are rarely used by the author although they are common in the industyr and are often used in interviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the evenings, it's worth exploring one or two videos from \n",
    "* StatQuests' the Basics (of statistics) \n",
    "* StatQuests' the Basics of Mahcine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Anki to memorize the key concepts in these videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables you to acquire a vocabulary and mindset that's often used to discuss data-related problems. Having a light overview also makes you aware of certain risks and wher you can learn more to mitigate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your portfolio, you have two types of portfolio projects.\n",
    "* Degree equivalent projects ( 1-3 months long result-driven projects that give you credibility )\n",
    "* Talent projects ( 1-4 week open projects that make you stand out )\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is what makes employers invite you to interviews, They give you evidence that you can do the job. Talent projects are both great for marketing yourself and making you stand out in the interview process. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you only have shiny talent projects, many employers will doubtthat you can do the daily grunt work to deliver on projects."
